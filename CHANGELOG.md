# CHANGE LOG

## 2026-09-05 - v4.3.0

- Make covers optional (`coverType: 'none'`). An omitted cover no longer emits `cover.xhtml` or cover metadata.
- Infer `coverType` from `metadata.cover` when the option is omitted: image resource → `image`, XHTML string → `text`, missing → `none`.
- Treat image covers as package metadata only: emit `properties="cover-image"` and the EPUB 2 `meta name="cover"`, but do not add `cover.xhtml` to the reading order.
- Give the cover image a stable manifest id of `cover-image` so the EPUB 2 `meta name="cover"` points at a real item.
- Keep text covers as a linear `cover.xhtml` document.

## 2026-08-09 - v4.2.0

- Generate an EPUB 3 navigation document for both contents-page option values.
- Add `showContentsInSpine`; retain `showContents` as a deprecated compatibility alias.
- Add `lang`, `xml:lang`, HTML5 doctypes, and `role="doc-toc"` to generated XHTML/navigation.
- Add caller-controlled accessibility discovery metadata fields.
- Add caller-controlled image-cover alternative text, including an explicit decorative empty-string value.
- Reject resource archive-path collisions, unknown media types, and unsafe section filenames.
- Accept section filename stems or complete `.xhtml` filenames.
- Make archive and output errors reject `write()` and clean up partial files when possible.
- Preserve the caller's exact title and zero-pad generated publication dates.
- Emit EPUB 3 series and group-position metadata while retaining Calibre compatibility metadata.
- Pin artifact validation to EPUBCheck 5.3.0 and Ace 1.4.6 in CI.
- Restore pnpm and externally packaged Pug templates by rebuilding on `@dylanarmstrong/nodepub` 4.1.5.
- Restore a pnpm-based clean `prepare` build so Git dependencies contain compiled output without stale files.

## v2.0.7

- Thanks to [Harold Treen](https://github.com/haroldtreen) the API has switched to being asynchronous

## v1.0.7

- This version introduces stability at the expense of minor breaking changes, consisting almost entirely of renames from chapter to section but with some of the pre-generated pages of earlier versions eliminated. The result is more abstracted but also more flexible, whilst also retaining most of it's simplicity.
